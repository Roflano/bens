A lot of people dream of living downtown, especially in cities with old housing. But downtown is not just pretty architecture and quick access to everything, it’s also old infrastructure, especially sewers and plumbing. I ran into this when I moved to Seattle, and it’s not just old pipes, it’s roots growing right into the pipes [https://bens.plumbing/services/drain-cleaning-seattle/rooter-service/](https://bens.plumbing/services/drain-cleaning-seattle/rooter-service/). I was told to keep bens plumbing in mind just in case, because these plumbers know how to handle even really bad cases and complicated situations. Moving into an old house, even if it looks nice, you have to be ready for problems like that.
